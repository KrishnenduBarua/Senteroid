## **High-Level Project Summary**

Understanding asteroid threats is critical for planetary defense, but raw NASA data remains inaccessible to the general public. The "Impactor-2025" scenario highlighted a crucial gap: people struggle to comprehend what asteroid parameters actually mean for Earth's safety. Existing datasets from NASA NeoWs, JPL SBDB, and USGS are fragmented and require expertise to interpret.
Hence, we developed **SENTEROID** - an interactive web platform that transforms complex NASA near-Earth object data into intuitive visualizations and simulations. Users can explore real asteroids and comets in orbit, simulate hypothetical impacts with scientifically-grounded calculations, learn mitigation strategies through interactive storytelling, and compare impact magnitudes with historical earthquakes. SENTEROID makes planetary defense education accessible to students, educators, and curious minds worldwide, turning intimidating numbers into understandable experiences.
